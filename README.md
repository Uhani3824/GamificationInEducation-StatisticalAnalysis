**Gamification in Education: Impact on Student's Learning, Motivation, and Performance**
This project analyzes the impact of gamification on students' learning, motivation, and overall performance. Using a survey-based approach, data was collected from students to evaluate their experiences with gamified learning environment called 'quizalize'. The data was analyzed using various statistical tests to assess the effectiveness of gamification.

**Key Highlights:**

Data Collection: Data was gathered via surveys from students, with 104 records. The survey responses were compiled into an Excel file for easy review and further analysis. Each survey question corresponds to a column in the dataset.
Analysis: The data was analyzed using Python and Jupyter Notebook to perform statistical tests, such as Kruskul Wallis H test, Mann Whitney U test, Spearman Correlation and Chi Square analysis to assess the impact of gamification on key student outcomes like learning, motivation, and performance. Graphs and charts were created to showcase the results of the statistical tests and trends observed in the data.
